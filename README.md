## Configuration
Edit the `.env` file to update the default WordPress MySQL user password and database, MySQL root password.
Feel free to check [Docker hub Tag page](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/litespeedtech/litespeed/tags) if you want to update default litespeed and php versions (LSWS_VERSION and PHP_VERSION variables).

After containers are built and started, you can navigate to *http://localhost* or *http://SERVER_IP* to set up WordPress admin details.
